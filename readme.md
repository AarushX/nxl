# weird project

I'm trying to become more comfortable with the way graphics systems work here, and attempting to make my own formats that are compact and conevnient for my purposes. I plan to create two filetypes, NPXL and NVXL, where NPXL represents an image (pixel space) while NVXL can represent either a video or a voxel space in 3D.
